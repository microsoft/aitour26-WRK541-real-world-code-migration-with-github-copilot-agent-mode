## Local environment prerequisites

If you want to run the workshop locally instead of using GitHub Codespaces, make sure the following are already installed on your machine (we assume they're in place so you can jump straight into the exercises):

- A GitHub account with GitHub Copilot enabled in VS Code
- Git for cloning the repository
- Visual Studio Code
- Python 3.12 and `pip` (to install `src/python-app/requirements.txt`)
- .NET 10 SDK (for the C# Minimal API)
- Optional: REST Client extension for testing endpoints from VS Code

For detailed installation and verification steps, see the full prerequisite checklist in the repository: [Local Development Prerequisites](../../PREREQUISITES.md).
