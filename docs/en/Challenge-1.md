## Challenge 1: Containerizing the project

**Difficulty:** 🔥 Intermediate

Containerize this project so that users can run it in other environments
without having to install and compile dependencies.

Use Agent mode to help you create the Dockerfile.

1. Ask Copilot to help you generate a Dockerfile to containerize the C#
   project
1. Review the Dockerfile created, optionally use Agent mode to make
   specific changes to the file
1. Finally, use Agent mode to help verify the container builds and can run as expected

Make adjustments as needed to ensure the container works.
